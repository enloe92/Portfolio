            <h3>About Me</h3> <!-- about me section -->
            <p>After high school I joined the work force, shortly thereafter I found a company that needed assistance with data transfer from an old inventory system to a new one, I've always been drawn to computer work so I gave it a shot. Turns out it was something I loved doing, and once the data transfer was completed I created a training manual for the company and stayed on running their inventory system until eventually they closed the location I was working out of.</p> <!-- paragraph -->
            <p>I then went to work for Walmart, and that is where I worked up until earlier this year when my position was eliminated due to COVID related changes. I started as a stocker and quickly rose to department manager. After doing that for about a year I was given an opportunity to go to the Walmart Academy(where they train all new managers for our region) as a trainer. Again after about a year I promoted to Assistant Store Manager moving over to the Sam's Club side of things. I did that for about a year and a half before the COVID changes occurred, and being the least tenured it left me displaced.</p> <!-- paragraph -->
            <p>All of this has given me an opportunity to choose a new path in life, one that I feel very excited to pursue with Thinkful.</p> <!-- paragraph -->
            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer with plenty of business experience I would love to hear from you!</p> <!-- paragraph -->
